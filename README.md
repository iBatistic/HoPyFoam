# HoPyFOAM  
### FOAM like Python code for High-order Finite Volume Method

__HoPyFOAM__ is an OpenFOAM-like Python package written for a high-order finite volume method.  
The code is intended to solve solid mechanics problems on 2D and 3D unstructured meshes.  
It is based on [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [petsc4py](https://petsc.org/release/petsc4py/) packages while the coding style and code structure is similar to one from the OpenFOAM library.
